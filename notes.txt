Couldn't use Firebaase functions to keep a canonical version of coinz map. This would have been useful so that the server knew what coin IDs there were so that the client can't invent coinz and bank them. To do this, would have needed to use a Firebase function that pulls in the map from stg homepage and stores the coinz in the DB, but to access external networks in Firebase functions you need to "set up billing account" and paid services are not allowed.
